        Akatsuki is a trans catgirl who writes code. She makes various content
        from YouTube videos to programming.
      </p>
      <p>
        Her projects contain My Summer Car mods but she're not certainly
        limited to only that. she makes other projects such as Akabot, Astolfo
        Forge mod, Astolfo is coming for you and many more.
      </p>
      <p>
        Her My Summer Car mods include adding new features (Highway Car
        Breakdowns), completely changing the balance of the game (Asphalt
        Roads), adding completely unseen content into the game (LGBTQ Pride
        Flags) and even joke mods (OwOifier). she doesn't consider herself a My
        Summer Car modder though.
