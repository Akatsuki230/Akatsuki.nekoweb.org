                <p>
                    Big changes are happening on my website! We've moved to a
                    sleek, new domain: <a href="https://akatsuki.nekoweb.org"
                        >akatsuki.nekoweb.org</a
                    >. Say goodbye to the old <a
                        href="https://akatsuki.codeberg.page"
                        >akatsuki.codeberg.page</a
                    > and embrace the fresh, dynamic vibe of our new home!
                </p>
                <p>
                    Why the switch? Simple. The new domain rolls off the tongue
                    effortlessly, making it easier for visitors to remember and
                    share. Plus, it aligns perfectly with our evolving brand
                    identity.
