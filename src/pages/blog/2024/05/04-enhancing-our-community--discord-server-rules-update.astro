                Hello everyone! As our Discord community continues to grow, we
                understand the importance of ensuring that it remains a safe,
                fun, and inclusive space for all of our members. To achieve
                this, we have recently updated our server rules to better
                reflect our commitment to fostering a respectful and positive
                environment.
            </p>
            <p>
                In this blog post, we'll provide an overview of the main
                changes, which include updated guidelines for jokes and humor,
                as well as revised rules on NSFW/Lewd content.
            </p>
            <h2>Setting Boundaries for Humor</h2>
            <p>
                We love a good laugh and appreciate the value that humor can
                bring to a community. However, we also recognize the importance
                of being mindful of the fine line between harmless jokes and
                potentially hurtful remarks. With this in mind, we have
                clarified our rules to emphasize the distinction between
                acceptable jokes and those that may be deemed offensive or
                inappropriate. Our goal is to promote a lighthearted atmosphere
                while ensuring that everyone feels respected and comfortable.
            </p>
            <h2>Refining NSFW/Lewd Content Guidelines</h2>
            <p>
                While we understand that many members appreciate mature content,
                we want to ensure that it is shared responsibly and that all
                community members feel safe when participating in discussions.
                To accomplish this, we have updated our guidelines on NSFW/Lewd
                content to ensure that such material is shared only in
                designated channels and with appropriate tags.
            </p>
            <p>
                These updates aim to strike a balance between freedom of
                expression and the well-being of all our members, creating a
                comfortable environment for everyone to enjoy.
            </p>
            <h2>Reviewing the Updated Rules</h2>
            <p>
                We encourage all our community members to take a moment to
                review the updated rules and guidelines. Your cooperation and
                understanding are greatly appreciated, and we thank you for
                helping us maintain a welcoming, inclusive, and enjoyable space
                for everyone to share their passions and connect with
                like-minded individuals.
            </p>
            <p>
                As always, we welcome your feedback and suggestions on how we
                can continue to improve our server. Your input is essential in
                helping us make our community the best it can be.
            </p>
            <p>Happy chatting!</p>
